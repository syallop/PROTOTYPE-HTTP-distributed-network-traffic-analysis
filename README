This directory contains two subdirectories of prototype components.

/CaptureManager - Contains files defining a prototype CaptureManager implementation, a program allowing the 
                  creation and manipulation of PCAP sources.

/ApplicationServer - Contains files defining a HTTP API to a underlying CaptureManager to allow control from within a webbrowser
test.sh - a bash script for testing purposes. Provided the two components have been built successfully, will run them both together.


Each component has its own README containing information on their dependencies, how to build them and their useage.
